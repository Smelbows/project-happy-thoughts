# Happy Thoughts

Happy thoughts is a website built in React where a user can post a happy thought, see others' happy thoughts and give hearts to posts. It uses a shared Technigo API where it fetches from and posts to, and it uses State and Effect hooks to control the user experience.

## The problem

I spent some time learning and understanding how to use the Effect hook, and used the given style template for the most part so that I could just focus on the React components. The project isn't quite finnished yet as I've been ill, so the next thing to do is to add in the funtionality for 'liking' a post.
