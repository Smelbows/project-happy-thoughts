# Happy Thoughts

Happy thoughts is a website built in React where a user can post a happy thought, see others' happy thoughts and give hearts to posts. It uses a shared Technigo API where it fetches from and posts to, and it uses State and Effect hooks to control the user experience.

## The problem

I spent some time learning and understanding how to use the Effect hook, and used the given style template for the most part so that I could just focus on the React components.
I've added a state hook for loading and would like to look into different ways to use and style this if I had more time on this.
